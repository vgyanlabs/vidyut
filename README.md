Here is the First logo for Vidyut where the book represents knowledge and the lightening bolt is for powering up the mind with knowledge.

I am trying on some different logos also, this is the first one.

And color palette I have chosen is this.
1. Primary Brand Color – Electric Blue
HEX: #007BFF

    Emotion: Trust, intelligence, clarity

    Usage: Buttons, links, headers (30%)

2. Secondary Color – Warm Yellow
HEX: #FFD54F

    Emotion: Excitement, energy, optimism

    Usage: Hover states, highlight boxes, cards (10%)

3. Neutral Background – Soft White
HEX: #FAFAFA

   Clean, modern, easy on the eyes

   Usage: Backgrounds (60%)

4. Supportive Color – Cool Slate Gray
HEX: #37474F

    Adds contrast for text and icons

    Usage: Body text, icons, footer

5. Optional Accent – Aqua Cyan
HEX: #00B8D4

    Fresh, playful tone for badges or status indicators

    Use sparingly (under 5%)
