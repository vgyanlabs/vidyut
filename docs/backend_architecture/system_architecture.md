#  System Architecture 

### Overall System Architecture

The learning platform follows a modern, microservices-inspired architecture that prioritizes modularity, scalability, and maintainability. The system is designed with clear separation of concerns, enabling independent development, testing, and deployment of different components.

**Architecture Layers:**

**Frontend Layer:** The Next.js application serves as the user interface, providing server-side rendering capabilities and a responsive user experience. This layer handles user interactions, form submissions, and data presentation. The choice of Next.js as a full-stack framework aligns with the requirement to use it for both frontend and backend functionality.

**API Gateway/Router Layer:** RESTful API endpoints are organized by functionality, providing a clean interface between the frontend and business logic. This layer handles request routing, authentication validation, input sanitization, and response formatting. The modular organization allows for easy maintenance and testing of individual API groups.

**Authentication Layer:** JWT-based authentication integrates with the existing user authentication system, providing secure access control across all protected endpoints. This layer validates user tokens, manages session state, and enforces role-based access control for administrative functions.

**Business Logic Layer:** Core application services are separated into distinct modules: Course Management handles course and level operations, Quiz Engine manages question generation and quiz flow, Progress Tracking monitors user performance, and PDF Export generates downloadable study materials. This separation enables independent scaling and maintenance of each service.

**External Services Layer:** The LLM Service operates as a separate microservice, providing question generation, explanation creation, and sub-question generation capabilities. This separation allows for easy integration of different LLM providers and independent scaling based on AI processing demands.

**Database Layer:** MongoDB serves as the primary data store, with collections optimized for the platform's specific data access patterns. The document-based structure aligns well with the hierarchical nature of courses, levels, and questions.

**Caching and Storage:** Redis provides performance optimization through caching of frequently accessed data, while file storage handles course images and generated PDF exports. This combination ensures fast response times and efficient resource utilization.

### Database Schema Relationships

The database design emphasizes data integrity, query efficiency, and scalability. The relationship structure supports complex queries while maintaining performance through proper indexing and data organization.

**Primary Relationships:**

**User to UserProgress (One-to-Many):** Each user can have multiple progress records, enabling detailed tracking of learning activities. This relationship supports comprehensive analytics and personalized learning insights.

**Course to Level (One-to-Many):** Courses contain multiple difficulty levels, allowing for structured learning progression. The relationship enables easy addition of new levels without affecting existing course structure.

**Level to QuizQuestion (One-to-Many):** Each level contains multiple questions, supporting varied content and preventing question repetition. This relationship enables level-specific question pools and difficulty management.

**QuizQuestion Self-Reference (Parent-Child):** Questions can have sub-questions, enabling the sophisticated wrong-answer handling logic. This self-referencing relationship supports the platform's unique educational approach of providing additional practice when users struggle with concepts.

**UserProgress Multi-Reference:** Progress records reference User, Course, Level, and QuizQuestion, providing comprehensive context for each learning interaction. This rich relationship structure enables complex analytics and progress tracking across multiple dimensions.

**Design Rationale:**

The schema design prioritizes flexibility and extensibility while maintaining query performance. The use of ObjectId references enables efficient joins in MongoDB while preserving data integrity. The granular progress tracking supports future features like adaptive learning algorithms and detailed performance analytics.

###  Quiz Functionality Flow

The quiz flow represents the core educational experience of the platform, implementing sophisticated logic for both correct and incorrect answer handling.

**Main Quiz Flow:**

The process begins when a user selects a course level, triggering the display of a static concept breakdown that sets expectations for the learning content. Upon clicking "Start Quiz," the system initializes a quiz session and generates the first question through the LLM service.

Each question presents four multiple-choice options, and the user's selection triggers different response paths. For correct answers, the system highlights the correct choice, displays an LLM-generated explanation summary, records the progress, and proceeds to the next question. This positive reinforcement approach helps solidify understanding of correctly grasped concepts.

**Wrong Answer Handling:**

The platform's unique value proposition emerges in its handling of incorrect answers. When a user selects a wrong answer, the system first shows the correct answer and provides an explanation summary, similar to the correct answer flow. However, instead of proceeding to the next main question, the system generates three related sub-questions at a slightly lower difficulty level.

These sub-questions focus on the same concept but approach it from different angles, providing the user with additional practice and confidence building. Only after successfully completing all three sub-questions does the user return to the main quiz progression. This approach ensures that users truly understand concepts before moving forward, rather than simply memorizing answers.

**Progress and Completion:**

Throughout the quiz, the system tracks progress and maintains session state, enabling features like pause and resume functionality. Upon completion of all questions for a level, users receive a comprehensive summary of their performance and the option to export their quiz content as a PDF for offline study.

### User Journey Flow

The user journey encompasses the complete learning experience from authentication to course completion, emphasizing user engagement and educational effectiveness.

**Dashboard Experience:**

After authentication, users land on a personalized dashboard displaying key metrics: courses completed, hours learned, and current learning streak. This gamification approach encourages continued engagement and provides immediate feedback on learning progress.

**Course and Level Selection:**

The course selection interface presents available courses with visual elements and progress indicators. Upon selecting a course, users choose from available difficulty levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced), each with its own concept breakdown and question frequency.

**Learning Cycle:**

The core learning cycle involves question presentation, answer selection, immediate feedback, and progress tracking. The system maintains engagement through varied question types and immediate explanatory feedback, ensuring that learning occurs with each interaction.

**Progress Tracking:**

Throughout the journey, the system continuously updates user progress data, enabling real-time dashboard updates and analytics. This data feeds into the dashboard metrics and supports features like streak tracking and weak area identification.

**Completion and Export:**

Upon completing a quiz level, users receive detailed performance summaries and the option to export their learning materials as PDF documents. This export feature transforms the digital learning experience into tangible study materials, extending the platform's value beyond the immediate quiz interaction.

### LLM Integration Architecture

The LLM integration represents a critical component of the platform's educational effectiveness, providing dynamic content generation while maintaining system reliability and performance.

**Service Separation:**

The LLM service operates as an independent microservice, communicating with the main application through well-defined API endpoints. This separation enables independent scaling, different deployment strategies, and easy integration of alternative LLM providers without affecting the core application.

**Content Generation Functions:**

The LLM service provides three primary functions: question generation creates new quiz questions with multiple-choice options, explanation generation produces educational summaries for correct answers, and sub-question generation creates related questions for wrong answer scenarios.

**Communication Patterns:**

The main application communicates with the LLM service through authenticated API calls, with each request including context about the course level, topic, and desired difficulty. Response caching minimizes redundant LLM calls and improves response times for similar requests.

**Reliability and Performance:**

The integration includes comprehensive error handling and fallback strategies to ensure system reliability even when the LLM service experiences issues. Rate limiting and throttling prevent overuse of LLM resources while maintaining responsive user experiences.

**Data Flow:**

When a new question is needed, the main application sends a request to the LLM service with level context and topic information. The LLM service generates appropriate content and returns structured data including question text, options, correct answer, and explanation. This content is then stored in the main database for future reference and PDF export functionality.

The architecture design ensures that the platform can leverage advanced AI capabilities while maintaining system reliability, performance, and maintainability. The modular approach enables future enhancements and technology updates without requiring complete system redesigns.
