# Knowledge Graph Feature Specifications for StudyPro

## Overview
The StudyPro application will implement an automated knowledge graph system for Computer Science education that visualizes connections between study materials and concepts. The system will automatically generate and update knowledge graphs based on student interactions with the platform, while allowing students to make manual edits when needed. The primary goal is to highlight knowledge gaps by making nodes that represent gaps non-clickable, guiding students toward areas that need additional study.

## Core Feature Requirements

### 1. Automated Knowledge Graph Generation
- **Data Sources**: 
  - Student quiz performance data
  - Study session interactions with LLM
  - Course materials and curriculum structure
  - Student engagement metrics (time spent, completion rates)
  
- **Node Generation**:
  - Automatically extract key CS concepts from study materials
  - Create nodes for fundamental concepts (data structures, algorithms, programming paradigms)
  - Assign proficiency levels to nodes based on student performance
  - Highlight knowledge gaps as non-clickable nodes

- **Edge Generation**:
  - Create relationships between concepts based on curriculum structure
  - Identify prerequisite relationships between topics
  - Weight connections based on conceptual relevance
  - Update edge weights based on student performance

### 2. Knowledge Gap Identification
- **Gap Detection Algorithm**:
  - Analyze quiz performance to identify concepts with low proficiency
  - Track concepts that are prerequisites for currently studied material
  - Monitor time spent on specific topics relative to expected mastery time
  - Identify concepts that are frequently revisited but show limited improvement

- **Visual Representation**:
  - Non-clickable nodes for concepts with identified knowledge gaps
  - Color-coding system to indicate proficiency levels
  - Size variation to represent importance or difficulty of concepts
  - Visual indicators for recommended next study areas

### 3. Student Interaction Capabilities
- **Manual Editing**:
  - Allow students to add personal notes to nodes
  - Enable creation of custom nodes for personal study topics
  - Permit manual connection of related concepts
  - Support tagging of nodes with personal relevance markers

- **Navigation and Exploration**:
  - Interactive zooming and panning of the knowledge graph
  - Search functionality to locate specific concepts
  - Filtering options to focus on specific subject areas
  - Path visualization between prerequisite and advanced concepts

### 4. LLM Integration
- **Knowledge Extraction**:
  - Use LLM to extract key concepts from study materials
  - Analyze study session transcripts to identify discussed topics
  - Generate concept relationships based on semantic understanding
  - Create natural language explanations of concept relationships

- **Personalization**:
  - Adapt knowledge graph based on student's learning style
  - Generate personalized study recommendations
  - Provide explanations for why certain nodes are identified as gaps
  - Create custom quizzes targeting identified knowledge gaps

## Technical Specifications

### Data Storage
- Store knowledge graph data as a collection of nodes and edges in a graph database
- Maintain student-specific proficiency metrics for each node
- Track historical performance to show progress over time
- Cache frequently accessed subgraphs for performance optimization

### Backend Processing
- Implement incremental graph updates rather than full regeneration
- Schedule periodic analysis of student performance data
- Process study session transcripts using NLP techniques
- Apply graph algorithms to identify optimal learning paths

### API Requirements
- Endpoints for retrieving personalized knowledge graphs
- Methods for updating node proficiency levels
- Interfaces for student-initiated graph modifications
- Query capabilities for specific subgraphs or concept areas

## Implementation Considerations

### Privacy and Data Security
- Ensure student performance data is securely stored
- Implement appropriate access controls for personal knowledge graphs
