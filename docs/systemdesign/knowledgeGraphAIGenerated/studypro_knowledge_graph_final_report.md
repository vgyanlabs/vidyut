# StudyPro Knowledge Graph Feature: Final Report

## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive analysis and implementation plan for integrating an automated knowledge graph feature into the StudyPro application for Computer Science education. The proposed feature will automatically generate and maintain knowledge graphs based on student interactions, while highlighting knowledge gaps as non-clickable nodes to guide students toward areas needing additional study.

Based on our research and analysis, we recommend a hybrid approach that combines automated knowledge graph generation with limited student editing capabilities. This approach leverages LLM technology to extract concepts from study materials and student interactions, while allowing students to personalize their learning experience through manual additions and annotations.

The implementation can be achieved through a phased approach over 10 months, with estimated infrastructure costs of $700-1,900/month and development resources of 4.5-6.5 FTE.
