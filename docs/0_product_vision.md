# Product Vision

## What is Vidyut?

Vidyut is a lightweight learning and evaluation platform designed to support learners, particularly final-year engineering students and early-career professionals, in assessing and improving their technical knowledge through structured quizzes and performance tracking.

## Vision Statement

To empower learners by combining focused evaluation with goal-driven feedback, enabling self-paced skill improvement aligned with industry expectations.

## Why Are We Building This?

- There is a gap in the market for tools that combine structured self-assessment with meaningful progress insights.
- Most existing platforms focus on delivering content but lack a streamlined mechanism to evaluate preparedness.
- Final-year students often seek tools to validate their knowledge before campus placements or job applications.
- Vidyut aims to fill this gap by enabling users to test, track, and improve their readiness in a structured and minimal environment.

## Who Is This For?

- Final-year engineering students preparing for placements
- Self-learners looking to validate their technical knowledge
- Job seekers preparing for assessments in product-based companies

## How Is Vidyut Different?

- Focused on evaluation through quizzes rather than long-form content
- Minimal interface to reduce distraction and increase usability
- Future potential to integrate personalized learning paths and gamification
- Quick go-to-market strategy with a usable MVP to gather feedback

## Long-Term Goal (Beyond MVP)

- Add structured content modules linked to quiz topics
- Introduce adaptive testing based on learner level and performance
- Provide visual dashboards for users to track strengths and weaknesses
- Develop gamification features to increase engagement and motivation
- Explore integration with resume-building tools or skill portfolios
