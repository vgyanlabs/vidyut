As we discussed yesterday, i am having a requirement, you can take this as one of the module. I am teaching ML lab, as you know there are tones of lines of coding. Currently this what i do:
1. Prepare codes and share to students 
2. Students execute them and notedown the outcome
3. Write journal and submit
4. Test and exams - Students memorize the code and take exam

What i want as teacher:
1. I will share the notebook, ask them to execute and observe (here passing marks students will get)
2. Assign them a task to do 
3. Auto-assessment of the code the students write. 
4. Students take a proctored online quiz for each assignment i give
5. Auto-assessment tool will give feedback to student. 
6. Test includes a Capstone project and i need a evaluation tool for the projects submitted. 
7. Examination - Implement steps in ML algorithms, like data preprocessing tools, evaluation tools, give different datasets, etc.
