To initiate Sprint 1 for the AI-powered teaching and learning assistant project, we‚Äôll focus on establishing foundational elements across all teams. The sprint will span two weeks, with the following objectives:
	‚Ä¢	Frontend: Set up the initial user interface framework.
	‚Ä¢	Backend: Develop the core server infrastructure.
	‚Ä¢	Data Management: Establish databases and data handling protocols.
	‚Ä¢	Market Research & UX: Conduct preliminary research and draft user experience guidelines.
	‚Ä¢	Machine Learning Development: Prepare datasets and define model requirements.

Detailed Task Assignments:
	1.	Frontend (@Shravani Sindagi):
	‚Ä¢	Set up the project structure using ReactJS.
	‚Ä¢	Implement a responsive navigation bar.
	‚Ä¢	Design and develop the landing page with placeholders for dynamic content.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure cross-browser compatibility and mobile responsiveness.
	2.	Backend (@Yashas Patil, @Vijay üê®):
	‚Ä¢	Initialize the server using Node.js with Express framework.
	‚Ä¢	Set up RESTful API endpoints for user authentication (login, registration).
	‚Ä¢	Implement JWT-based authentication and authorization.
	‚Ä¢	Create API documentation for frontend integration.
	3.	Data Management (@Vishwanath K., @Vijay üê®):
	‚Ä¢	Design the database schema using PostgreSQL.
	‚Ä¢	Set up ORM using Sequelize for Node.js.
	‚Ä¢	Implement initial database migrations and seed data.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure data validation and integrity constraints are in place.
	4.	Market Research & UX (@Tejaswini R Badiger, @Vishwanath K.):
	‚Ä¢	Conduct competitor analysis focusing on existing AI teaching assistants. Ôøº
	‚Ä¢	Gather user requirements through surveys or interviews with educators and students.
	‚Ä¢	Develop user personas to guide design decisions.
	‚Ä¢	Create wireframes for key user interfaces based on research findings.
	5.	Machine Learning Development (@Disha, @Bhumika):
	‚Ä¢	Collect and preprocess datasets relevant to the educational domain.
	‚Ä¢	Define evaluation metrics and baseline models for initial testing.
	‚Ä¢	Set up a development environment with necessary libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
	‚Ä¢	Begin exploratory data analysis to inform model selection.

Sprint Deliverables:
	‚Ä¢	A functional frontend interface with basic navigation and landing page.
	‚Ä¢	Backend APIs supporting user authentication with documentation.
	‚Ä¢	A structured and populated database ready for integration. Ôøº
	‚Ä¢	Comprehensive market research report and initial UX wireframes.
	‚Ä¢	Prepared datasets and a clear plan for model development.

Sprint Timeline:
	‚Ä¢	Week 1:
	‚Ä¢	Day 1-2: Kickoff meetings, environment setup, and task assignments.
	‚Ä¢	Day 3-5: Execution of tasks as per the assignments above. Ôøº
	‚Ä¢	Week 2:
	‚Ä¢	Day 6-8: Continue development and begin integration of components.
	‚Ä¢	Day 9: Internal testing and validation of developed features.
	‚Ä¢	Day 10: Sprint review meeting to demonstrate progress and gather feedback.

Collaboration Tools:
	‚Ä¢	Version Control: GitHub for source code management.
	‚Ä¢	Project Management: Jira or Trello for task tracking and sprint planning.
	‚Ä¢	Communication: Slack for daily communication and Zoom for meetings.

This structured approach ensures that all teams work cohesively towards building a solid foundation for the AI-powered teaching and learning assistant.
